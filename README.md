## Introduction

Access to clean and potable water is crucial for human health. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify water samples as potable or non-potable based on various chemical and physical attributes. 

The project employs:
- **DVC** for managing data and pipelines.
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking.
- **DAGs** for orchestrating workflows.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Trains multiple classifiers to predict water potability.
- **Pipeline Automation**: Uses DVC and DAGs to automate the ML workflow.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Tracks experiments and results with MLflow.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures the entire workflow is reproducible.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Pipeline Tools**: DVC, DAGs
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-potability-prediction.git
   cd water-potability-prediction
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up DVC:
   ```bash
   dvc init
   dvc pull
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Track experiments with MLflow**:
   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```

4. **Run the pipeline**:
   ```bash
   dvc repro
   ```
